### **Project Plan: Analyzing US COVID-19 Vaccination Rates**

The goal is to understand the relationship between socio-economic factors (income, education, race) and COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States. The final output will be a comprehensive report with data visualizations that summarize the findings.

Here is a visual overview of the plan:

### **Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    *   **CDC Data:** I will source county-level COVID-19 vaccination data from the CDC's public data repository.
    *   **US Census Data:** I will use the American Community Survey (ACS) to gather county-level data on:
        *   Median Household Income
        *   Educational Attainment (e.g., percentage of population with a bachelor's degree or higher)
        *   Racial and ethnic demographics.

2.  **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**
    *   The datasets will be loaded and merged based on a common geographical identifier (like county FIPS codes).
    *   I will address any missing data and ensure data types are consistent for analysis.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   I will calculate descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
    *   I will create visualizations to explore relationships, such as:
        *   A **correlation matrix** to see the initial relationships between all variables.
        *   **Scatter plots** to visualize the relationship between vaccination rates and income/education levels.
        *   **Box plots** to compare vaccination rates across different racial and ethnic groups.

4.  **Model Building:**
    *   I will use a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict vaccination rates based on the selected socio-economic factors. This model is a good starting point for understanding the linear relationships between the variables.
    *   The data will be split into training and testing sets to ensure the model can generalize to new data.

5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    *   The model's performance will be assessed using standard metrics like **R-squared**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

6.  **Interpretation & Visualization (Final Report):**
    *   I will interpret the model's coefficients to explain how each socio-economic factor influences vaccination rates.
    *   All the analysis and visualizations will be compiled into a final report, likely as a Jupyter Notebook or a markdown file, that clearly presents the findings.
